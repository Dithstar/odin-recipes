# odin-recipes
In this project, I learned how to create a recipe webpage where I created relative links to pages, added images, and created lists. I learned how important file structure is and why it must be organized.
<p>Links to relative pages begin with < a href=""></a> while images begin with < img src="" alt="" width="">.</p>
<p>I also learned how to upload my project to github and commit changes.</p>
<p>I realized that there is a preview page in github when making edits so I don't have to commit every time I make a change and then realize it's wrong.</p>
