# odin-recipes
In this project, I learned how to create a recipe webpage where I created relative links to pages, added images, and created lists. I learned how important file structure is and why it must be organized.
Links to relative pages begin with <a href=""></a> while images begin with <img src="" alt="" width="">.
I also learned how to upload my project to github and commit changes.
